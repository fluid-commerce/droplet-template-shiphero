## ~~ðŸŸ  Priority 2: Missing Core Functionality~~ âœ… MOSTLY COMPLETED

### ~~2.1 Implement Fluid Order Status Updates~~ âœ…
**Status:** COMPLETED

**What was implemented:**
- âœ… Created `FluidApi::BaseService` - Base service with authentication
- âœ… Created `FluidApi::V2::OrdersService` - Updates external_id on orders
- âœ… Created `FluidApi::Commerce::OrderService` - Creates order fulfillments
- âœ… Integrated into `ShipHero::CreateOrder` to update Fluid orders
- âœ… Stores ShipHero order ID as external_id in Fluid

### ~~2.2 Implement ShipHero Incoming Webhooks~~ âœ…
**Status:** COMPLETED (Framework ready, needs webhook registration)

**What was implemented:**
1. âœ… **Order Fulfillment/Shipment Flow**
   - Created: `app/jobs/order_shipped_job.rb`
   - Created: `app/services/ship_hero/sync_shipped_order.rb`
   - Updates Fluid order with tracking information
   - Creates fulfillment in Fluid

**Still needed:**
- Register webhook URL in ShipHero dashboard
- Determine exact event name ShipHero uses
- Test with real ShipHero webhooks
- Add event handler registration once webhook format is known

### 2.3 Implement Inventory Management (Phase 2)
**File:** `app/frontend/components/InventoryManagement.tsx`

**Current state:** Shows mock/placeholder data only

**What's needed:**
1. Create backend API endpoints:
   - `GET /api/inventory_sync_jobs` - List sync jobs
   - `POST /api/inventory_sync_jobs` - Trigger manual sync
   - `GET /api/inventory_sync_jobs/:id` - Job details

2. Create services:
   - `app/services/ship_hero/fetch_inventory.rb` - Query ShipHero for inventory
   - `app/services/inventory_sync_service.rb` - Sync inventory to Fluid

3. Create background job:
   - `app/jobs/inventory_sync_job.rb` - Periodic inventory sync

4. Update React component:
   - Fetch real data from API
   - Display actual sync history
   - Add filters and search
   - Show sync status and errors

5. Create database table (optional):
   - Store inventory sync history for reporting

### 2.4 Implement Shipping Tracking
**File:** `app/frontend/components/ShippingTracking.tsx`

**What's needed:**
1. Review current implementation (not examined in detail)
2. Create API endpoints for tracking data
3. Connect to ShipHero tracking queries
4. Display real tracking information
5. Allow manual tracking lookup

### 2.5 Create Order Mapping System
**Status:** Not implemented

**What's needed:**
- Create `OrderMapping` model to store Fluid â†” ShipHero order relationships
- Migration:
  ```ruby
  create_table :order_mappings do |t|
    t.bigint :company_id, null: false
    t.string :fluid_order_id, null: false
    t.string :shiphero_order_id, null: false
    t.string :status
    t.jsonb :metadata, default: {}
    t.timestamps
  end
  ```
- Add indexes on both ID columns
- Use this for status updates and troubleshooting

## ðŸŸ¡ Priority 3: Data Quality & Validation

### 3.1 Remove Hardcoded Test Data
**File:** `app/services/ship_hero/create_order.rb`

**Locations:**
- Line 44: `order_number: 5` should be generated/from payload
- Line 59: `state_code: params[:ship_to][:state_code] || 'UT'` - remove fallback
- Line 73: `sku: product[:sku] || 'P102'` - remove fallback, require real SKU

### 3.2 Add Data Validation
**Files:** Multiple

**What's needed:**
1. Validate required fields before calling ShipHero API
2. Add validation for:
   - Email format
   - Phone format
   - Address completeness
   - SKU existence
   - Quantity > 0
3. Return meaningful errors to users
4. Store validation errors in Events table

### 3.3 Handle Missing/Optional Fields
**File:** `app/services/ship_hero/create_order.rb`

**Issues:**
- Line 51: `first_name` and `last_name` both set to same `name` field
- Line 64: `phone` has fallback to empty string - may cause API errors
- Shipping address fields may not all be present

**Fix:**
- Parse name into first/last properly
- Validate required vs optional fields per ShipHero API docs
- Handle missing data gracefully with clear error messages

## Notes

- The foundation is solid - event handling, webhook receiving, and basic integrations work well
- Main issues are in business logic implementation and data sync
- Focus on Priority 1 and 2 first to get a working MVP
- UI components are well-structured but need backend APIs
- Testing infrastructure is in place but needs test cases written
- Consider adding feature flags for gradual rollout
